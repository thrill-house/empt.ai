### Sample component
This is a sample component, file and folder structure should be preserved to match the example set out here. Docs can be directly edited in the component itself. **Tweakers** can be added manually in the app component, to allow interaction with the component to demonstrate functionality. Component names should always be made up of two words, e.g. **sample-component**, so as to more easily distinguish them from standard HTML elements.

##### Properties
- `message` â€” A message to be displayed in the component

##### Instantiation
`<sample-component message="Hey there!"></sample-component>`
