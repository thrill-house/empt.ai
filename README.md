# Dash Game â€” Vue components

## Component library of user interface elements for the Dash game.

> Vue.js components for the Dash Game

## Build Setup

Download & Install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/), if you haven't already.

Then from the command line, navigate to your project directory:

```bash
# install dependencies
cd "/Path/to/project/directory"
```

Then install the required packages:

```bash
# install dependencies
npm install
```

If working locally, run the dev process to create a server that will automatically update as you make changes to code. Components will hot reload, maintaining your progress. Changes to storage files which contain the configuration values will reload the whole page, so be careful if you don't want to lose your game state:

```bash
# serve with hot reload at localhost:8080
npm run dev
```

To build for production, run the following commands. This should only need to be done on deployed instances.

```bash
# build for production with minification
npm run build
```

For detailed explanation on how things work, consult the [docs for vue-loader](https://vuejs.github.io/vue-loader).
